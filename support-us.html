				Our goal for the next generation of CYC is simple. We want to:
			</p>
			<ul id="goals-list">
				<li>Provide scholarships for those who need CYC but can’t afford it.</li>
				<li>Increase funding, sponsorships and donations so we can make CYC better than ever.</li>
				<li>Spend carefully, invest wisely – eventually we want camp to be self sustainable financially so that future generations can continue to join CYC.</li>
				<li>Foster the NEXT generation of leaders and create a pipeline for sustainable growth.</li>
				<li>Keep our culture alive!</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				You can help CYC by 3 very simple ways.
			</p>
			<ol id="help-list1">
				<li>Help camp grow! Attend camp, or send your kids to camp.  Tell your friends about CYC, beg your parents to let you attend, tell friends and classmates and school who’ve never heard of camp before but you KNOW attending would change their lives just like it changed yours.</li>
				<li>Volunteer at camp!  Whether it’s helping us plan as an officer / director / intern throughout the year or attending as an advisor, activities committee or yearbook staff, our non-profit CYC needs YOU to make it all happen!</li>
				<li>Donate to CYC! Your donation of any size will ensure that CYC can grow bigger and better from year to year.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				If you’re interested in volunteering, donating or supporting CYC in ANY way, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@HoustonCYC.com">info@HoustonCYC.com</a>!<br><br>Let’s grow CYC back like it was in the glory days. Maybe we won’t have 14 groups of 28 kids and 6 counselors and ACs, and maybe parents don’t need to line up at 5am the morning of registration to get their kids into CYC, BUT, we can work on:<br><br>
			</p>
			<ol id="help-list2">
				<li>Increasing Camper turnout so that we can touch and impact more kids!</li>
				<li>Increase funding and supplies so we can make CYC the best it can be!</li>
				<li>Develop a new generation of leaders!</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				More sponsorships and funding means a yo-yo or fan for every kid so that every camper can perform at closing ceremonies. It means more pages in the yearbook so that every camper can show their parents what they did at camp. It means more server space so we can eventually host photos and videos from every group on our website!<br><br>Thanks to every single volunteer, sponsor, parent, camper, teacher, AC and counselor who has support CYC throughout the years. Thanks to every parent and camper who has told another family about CYC so that we can continue to grow. Let’s keep it up!
