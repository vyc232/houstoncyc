				Dear Parents: <br><br>As you know this yearâ€™s CYC will be held at the University of Texas at Austin. We are very excited!  The new campus requires additional consent forms that must be completed and returned to Houston CYC by Friday, July 1, 2016.  These forms include:<br><br>Release and Indenification Agreement<br>Medical Treatment Authorization<br>These forms are similar to the consent forms you signed during our camp registration process.  However, UT Austin requires all camps using their campus to sign these forms.  In the future CYC will streamline and integrate these new forms into our registration process, but for this year we appreciate your cooperation and understanding in getting these forms to us ASAP!<br><br>Please complete the following:
			</p>
			<ol id="form-list">
				<li>Carefully review each form and fill out all pertinent information.</li>
				<li>Sign, date and return all forms back to Houston CYC at the address below.</li>
				<li><b>EACH CAMPER</b> must have their own set of forms, but families can mail forms in together.</li>
			</ol>	
			<p class="info-letter">
				<b>The deadline to return your forms is Friday, July 1, 2016</b>.  It is extremely important that all forms be returned by this date.  Failure to timely return your forms could result in the University prohibiting your son or daughter from participation in Houston CYC.<br><br>If you have any additional questions or concerns please do not hesitate to contact me via e-mail at <a href="mailto:info@houstoncyc.com">info@houstoncyc.com</a> or by phone at (281) 968-9096.  We hope to see your children at camp in a few short weeks!
